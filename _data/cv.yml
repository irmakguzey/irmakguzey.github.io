      institution: CILVR Lab, New York University, New York City, United States
      year: 2021-now 
      description:
        - Was co-author in Holo-Dex, (in submission, ICRA 2022) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06463). Implemented different self-supervised learning algorithms to improve visual representations using Pytorch. 
        - Developed a whole framework for a robot dog to manipulate objects on a state / vision based environment. Main goal was to make the dog push objects to desired positions. Used ROS and Pytorch.
        - Built and implemented software for a robot car to navigate randomly. Used contrastive predictive models to predict next visual observations. Used ROS and Pytorch.
