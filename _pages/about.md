I am a second year masters student in New York University studying Computer Science at Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. I was awarded with a Fulbright scholarship in 2020. 
I currently work as a graduate research assistant in Computational Intelligence, Vision, and Robotics Lab ([CILVR](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/)) at NYU and am lucky to be advised by [Prof. Lerrel Pinto](https://www.lerrelpinto.com/).

My research mostly focus on Robot Learning and Representation Learning. I enjoy working on tackling different tasks in Manipulation and Navigation in Robotics.

On top of my research, with my interest in Robotics and Machine Learning, I worked as a full-time robotics engineer in [DOF Robotics](https://dofrobotics.com/) for a year, had an internship in [X](https://x.company/) - the Moonshot Factory and 2 different internships in [Google](https://about.google/), one of them being purely on machine learning.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
