I am currently a first year PhD student in Computatinal Intelligence, Vision, and Robotics Lab ([CILVR](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/)) at NYU and am lucky to be advised by [Prof. Lerrel Pinto](https://www.lerrelpinto.com/).

I had my master's degree from New York University, Computer Science at Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. I was awarded with a Fulbright scholarship in 2020. 

My research mostly focus on *Policy Learning* and *Representation Learning*. I enjoy working on tackling different tasks in Manipulation and Navigation in Robotics.

On top of my research, with my interest in Robotics and Machine Learning, I worked as a full-time robotics engineer in [DOF Robotics](https://dofrobotics.com/) for a year, had an internship in [X](https://x.company/) - the Moonshot Factory and 2 different internships in [Google](https://about.google/), one of them being purely on machine learning.
