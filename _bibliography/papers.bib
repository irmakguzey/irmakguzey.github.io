  abstract={A fundamental challenge in teaching robots is to
provide an effective interface for human teachers to demonstrate useful skills to a robot. This challenge is exacerbated
in dexterous manipulation, where teaching high-dimensional,
contact-rich behaviors often require esoteric teleoperation tools.
In this work, we present HOLO-DEX, a framework for dexterous manipulation that places a teacher in an immersive mixed
reality through commodity VR headsets. The high-fidelity hand
pose estimator onboard the headset is used to teleoperate the
robot and collect demonstrations for a variety of generalpurpose dexterous tasks. Given these demonstrations, we use
powerful feature learning combined with non-parametric imitation to train dexterous skills. Our experiments on six common
dexterous tasks, including in-hand rotation, spinning, and bottle
opening, indicate that HOLO-DEX can both collect high-quality
demonstration data and train skills in a matter of hours. Finally,
we find that our trained skills can exhibit generalization on
objects not seen in training.},

  title={Human Motion Prediction With Graph Neural Networks},
  author={Guzey, Irmak and Tekden, Ahmet E. and Samur, Evren and Ugur, Emre},
  url={https://motionpredictionicra2020.github.io/posters/lhmp2020_guzey_paper.pdf},
  abstract={In this work, we propose to use graph neural networks, propagation networks in particular, to investigate the problem of modelling full-body motion.
  The body parts and the relations between them are encoded as the nodes of a graph and edges between these nodes. 
  How the nodes are related to each other is learned, and how the effects of multiple nodes on each node should be accumulated is computed in graph structure.},
