  abstract={A fundamental challenge in teaching robots is to
provide an effective interface for human teachers to demonstrate useful skills to a robot. This challenge is exacerbated
in dexterous manipulation, where teaching high-dimensional,
contact-rich behaviors often require esoteric teleoperation tools.
In this work, we present HOLO-DEX, a framework for dexterous manipulation that places a teacher in an immersive mixed
reality through commodity VR headsets. The high-fidelity hand
pose estimator onboard the headset is used to teleoperate the
robot and collect demonstrations for a variety of generalpurpose dexterous tasks. Given these demonstrations, we use
powerful feature learning combined with non-parametric imitation to train dexterous skills. Our experiments on six common
dexterous tasks, including in-hand rotation, spinning, and bottle
opening, indicate that HOLO-DEX can both collect high-quality
demonstration data and train skills in a matter of hours. Finally,
we find that our trained skills can exhibit generalization on
objects not seen in training.},

  abstract={In this work, we propose to use graph neural networks, propagation networks in particular, to investigate the problem of modelling full-body motion.
  The body parts and the relations between them are encoded as the nodes of a graph and edges between these nodes. 
  How the nodes are related to each other is learned, and how the effects of multiple nodes on each node should be accumulated is computed in graph structure.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
