We just published our latest project [TAVI (See to Touch: Learning Tactile Dexterity through Visual Incentives)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12300)! It is in submission to **ICRA 2023**. TAVI learns an online visuo-tactile policy using image only guidance. Learned policy can adapt to new environments under only 1 hour of training! For more check out [website](https://see-to-touch.github.io/) and [code](https://github.com/irmakguzey/see-to-touch).
