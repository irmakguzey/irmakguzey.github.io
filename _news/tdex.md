[T-Dex (Dexterity from Touch: Self-Supervised Pre-Training of Tactile Representations with Robotic Play)](https://tactile-dexterity.github.io/) got accepted to **CoRL 2023**! This is the first conference publication of mine as the main author. T-Dex is a dexterous manipulation framework that uses tactile observations. Tactile encoders are trained using SSL objectives on a tactile play data.
